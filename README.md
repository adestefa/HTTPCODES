# HTTPHEAD
A simple game with HTTP status response codes.

Hypertext and associated transfer protocol (HTTP) is the foundation the internet runs on. Altough far from perfect, it is still endearing in its own way.

Nontheless, it is what the web runs on, so a simple flash-card like study game would be a good idea. 

Maybe even get others interested in learning more.
